# how to (win10)

Game is only tested on the latest versions of Windows 10 and depends on it.

It requires Windows 10 build 17063 or later.

Run the following commands inside of Git Bash in order to download and start the game.

Required dependencies are: Git Bash (https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases), and Microsoft's modern 'Windows Terminal' (from the Microsoft Store, unless you are using LTSC, where the game has a launcher to download that Terminal for you.)

```git clone https://gitlab.com/Novimatrem/textadv.sh```

```cd textadv.sh```

```cmd "/C run-win-zoey.bat"```

(OR if you are on LTSC, this command instead:)

```cmd "/C run-win-LTSC-enterprise.bat"```

# how to (linux)

Run the following commands inside of your bash terminal emulator in order to download and start the game.

Required dependencies are: Bash, and a Terminal Emulator.

```git clone https://gitlab.com/Novimatrem/textadv.sh```

```cd textadv.sh```

```bash textadv.sh```

# how to (mac)
