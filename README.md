I have had technical issues halting any of my attempts to work on a port to Mac OS, and ReactOS.

The game officially runs on Windows 10, Linux, & Haiku.

If you have an operating system that isn't any of those, it could work, but you're on your own for getting it set up, and it may not function properly at all. Beware. 

# how to (win10)

Game is only tested on the latest versions of Windows 10 and depends on it.

It requires Windows 10 build 17063 or later.

Run the following commands inside of Git Bash in order to download and start the game.

Required dependencies are: Git Bash (https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases), and Microsoft's modern 'Windows Terminal' (from the Microsoft Store)

```git clone https://gitlab.com/Novimatrem/textadv.sh```

```cd textadv.sh```

```cmd "/C run-win-zoey.bat"```

# how to (linux)

Run the following commands inside of your bash terminal emulator in order to download and start the game.

Required dependencies are: Bash, and a Terminal Emulator.

```git clone https://gitlab.com/Novimatrem/textadv.sh```

```cd textadv.sh```

```bash textadv.sh```

# how to (haiku)

Run the following commands inside of 'Terminal' in order, to download and start the game.
